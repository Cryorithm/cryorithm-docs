# Cryorithm™ | Prompts | Evolve an Engineered Prompt

You can evolve an engineered prompt by applying prompt recursion.

The Immutable Prompt™ is a robust tool designed for crafting customized prompts to
streamline interactions with large language models (LLMs). It simplifies processes
ranging from complex queries to routine task automation by tailoring prompts according
to your unique requirements.

## Introduction

This guide is tailored for users who aim to optimize their use of LLMs through
precise, reusable prompts. Prompt recursion provides essential assistance after an
initial detailed interaction session.

## How It Works

The creation of customized prompts with prompt recursion unfolds across several phases:

1. **Submit the Immutable Prompt**: Start by inputting the comprehensive,
   flexible immutable prompt provided below.
2. **Interactive Questioning Phase**: Engage in a dialogue where prompt recursion
   collects detailed information about your goals and needs.
3. **Task Execution Phase**: Based on gathered insights, prompt recursion tailors the
   LLM's response strategy to efficiently meet your requests.
4. **Shortcut Creation Phase**: After completion, prompt recursion generates a
   "shortcut prompt" that facilitates similar future requests with minimal user input.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Initiating a Request**: Begin with the immutable prompt outlined below.
   Follow prompt recursion's guided steps for clear and effective request execution.
- **Using Shortcut Prompts**: Leverage generated shortcut prompts for quicker
   and more accurate responses in future interactions.
- **Providing Feedback**: Your feedback is invaluable for refining shortcut
   effectiveness and enhancing overall system performance.

## Immutable Prompt™

```markdown
Initiate a conversational session with the user to discern their specific needs
and precise objectives through targeted questioning. Utilize the gathered
information to meticulously execute the required tasks, adapting responses
according to their preferences and feedback. Upon successful completion of these
tasks:

1. Create a 'shortcut prompt' derived from this interaction that encapsulates
   the user’s requirements in a condensed, easily actionable format. This shortcut
   should be designed to streamline future requests by minimizing the need for
   repetitive exchanges.

2. Integrate into this shortcut prompt instructions for its ongoing refinement
   and self-enhancement each time it is utilized, ensuring that it evolves in
   alignment with changing user needs or preferences.

Additional protocols include:
- Implement continuous monitoring of interaction quality, leveraging both
  algorithmic assessments and user feedback to refine processes.
- Establish robust mechanisms for clarifying uncertainties and handling
  exceptions promptly and effectively.
- Maintain stringent data protection standards throughout all operations
  to safeguard user information.
