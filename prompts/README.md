## Introduction

**Welcome to Cryorithm Prompt Engineering!**

This folder houses a collection of prompts designed to drive, guide and enhance our
work. Each prompt focuses on a specific aspect of communication or content creation
that aligns with our organizational goals.

By utilizing these prompts, we aim to:

- **Increase consistency and quality:** Ensure our messaging aligns with Cryorithm's
  vision and maintains a high standard.
- **Boost efficiency:** Save time and effort by having pre-defined prompts for common
  tasks.
- **Spark creativity:** Generate innovative ideas and approaches within the framework
  of our goals.

## How to Use These Prompts

- Browse through the various subfolders within `prompts/`. Each subfolder will contain
  a specific prompt category (e.g., `prompts/blog-post`, `prompts/social-media`).
- Within each subfolder, you will find a `README.md` file that details the prompt's
  purpose, usage instructions, and any relevant examples.
- Feel free to contribute your own prompts! Create a new subfolder with a descriptive
  name following the established format (e.g., `prompts/press-release`). Add a
  `README.md` file outlining your prompt and its benefits.

We encourage active participation and continuous improvement of this resource. Let's
leverage the power of prompts to elevate Cryorithm's communication and content!
