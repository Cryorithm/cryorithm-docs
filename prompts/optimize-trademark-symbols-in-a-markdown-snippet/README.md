# Cryorithm™ | Prompts | Optimize Trademark Symbols in a Markdown Snippet

This prompt guides consistent and efficient application of the trademark symbol (™)
within Cryorithm's Markdown documents. By following this prompt, we better ensure
proper trademark identification while maintaining a concise and professional style in
our Cryorithm Markdown documents.

## Prompt


```markdown
Using the trademark symbol (™) consistently with your brand name helps to assert your
rights over it, especially when you haven't registered it as a formal trademark.
However, from a practical standpoint, including the symbol every single time the brand
name appears can be visually cumbersome and may detract from readability. Here’s a
guideline on how to balance its use:

1. **First Use in a Document or Section**: Include the ™ symbol at the first mention
   of the brand name in any document, webpage, or significant section thereof. This
   is critical as it asserts your claim right from the beginning.

2. **Prominent Display Locations**: Always use the ™ in prominent places such as
   titles, headers, logos, or any official statements where the brand identity needs
   strong emphasis.

3. **Repetitive Use in Text**: In long-form content where the brand name appears
   frequently, it’s not necessary to include ™ with every occurrence. Using it in the
   first mention per major section or page should suffice.

4. **External Communications and Marketing Materials**: In official communications,
   press releases, marketing materials, and advertisements, use the ™ symbol
   consistently with each appearance of the brand name to reinforce trademark claims.

5. **Legal and Formal Documents**: Always use ™ in more formal contexts such as legal
   documents, contracts, terms of service etc., where you want to explicitly indicate
   that you are asserting rights over a non-registered trademark.

By following these guidelines, you can effectively balance legal protection and
readability for your audience.
