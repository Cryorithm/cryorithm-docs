# Cryorithm™ | Organization | Charter

Cryorithm™ is an open-source software guild focused on developing modular components (e.g., "predictors") for investment strategies. Our goal is to empower individuals to build personalized investment tools without compromising their financial data privacy. We believe in fostering a collaborative environment built on shared ownership and best-effort contributions.

## Core Values

- **Open Source:** We are committed to the MIT License, encouraging transparency and community participation.
- **Modular Design:** Our focus is on building independent, reusable components such as predictors that can be combined for diverse strategies.
- **Data Privacy:** We prioritize protecting user data, enabling strategy development without information sharing.
- **Best-Effort Contribution:** We value active participation based on individual capacity, fostering a sustainable development model
.
- **Shared Ownership:** We believe in collective ownership of the Cryorithm organization on GitHub. Ownership role in the guild is gr
anted based on trust and contributions, but anyone can use the code under the MIT License.
- **Implementer's Choice:** Use your favorite tools and libraries! As long as at least one Owner approves your GitHub Pull Request (P
R) and the licenses work with the MIT License, we embrace your preferred approach.

## Technical Considerations

- **Modular Design:** Modules can be implemented in any programming language.
- **Standardized Interfaces:** Modules will utilize pre-defined input/output formats for seamless integration (e.g., text, number, label).
- **Default Toolkit:** Python with Pytest, Poetry (monorepo), or Hatch (single-project) is recommended for streamlined development. C
ommon libraries include Jupyter Notebook, PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas.
- **Bootstrapping:** Jupyter Notebook/Lab is the preferred environment for initial development.
- **Module Hubs:** One or more hubs that focus the forthcoming pool of Crytorithm modules.

## Collaboration

- **Ownership:** Adding an owner to the Cryorithm organization requires that a simple majority agrees about the additional owner. We prefer an odd number of owners, as that suits quorum-making far better. Owners that have zero activity for an entire year will lose their quorum-building contribution to the simple majority, until they merge a PR approved by at least one active owner. These are less so rules than they are practical mitigations to the way life changes without change.
- **Communication:** Collaboration will primarily occur through the Cryorithm GitHub organization.
- **Membership:** Membership is open to contributors who share our values and commitment.
- **Decision-Making:** Discussions and consensus building will guide project direction.

We believe in the power of collaboration to develop innovative investment tools. By working together, we can create a valuable resource for the financial technology landscape. In a sense, we're a kind of International Space Station in that we're an emergent system of modules built by disparate parties with overlapping goals.
