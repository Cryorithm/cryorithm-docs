# Cryorithm™ | Milestones | v1 ("The Wheel") | Architecture

**Status:** EARLY DRAFT

## Introduction

Cryorithm™ is an innovative, open-source, community-driven self-deployed platform
designed to empower individuals to manage and optimize their financial futures.
Utilizing a distributed plugin architecture composed of various financial predictors,
Cryorithm provides customized investment recommendations by aggregating insights from
a global network of contributors. Our commitment to data privacy and security ensures
that users can trust the reliability and integrity of the information provided.

## Overview

Version 1 of Cryorithm™, affectionately nicknamed "The Wheel", represents the
foundational step toward leveraging high technology for personal finance management.
Inspired by the pivotal advancements in
[Civilization IV](https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_technologies_in_Civ4),
"The Wheel" sets a robust groundwork for subsequent releases, each intended to
progressively enhance and refine our approach to financial technology.

### Components

**Predictors (Plugins)**: Diverse algorithms located both locally and remotely,
these plugins analyze various market trends and data points to generate financial
predictions.

**Fan-In Component**: A sophisticated large language model (LLM) that aggregates
outputs from all predictors and generates coherent, user-friendly advice on financial
matters.

**User Interface**: An intuitive portal through which users interact with the system,
posing questions and receiving personalized advice based on aggregated predictions.

### Architectural Patterns and Styles

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each predictor operates as an independent
    microservice, facilitating scalability and ease of updates.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes events to trigger communication between
    predictors and the fan-in component.
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Manages interactions between client applications
    (user interface) and backend services (predictors).

### Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python for backend services; JavaScript for front-end
    development.
- **Frameworks**: Flask or FastAPI for developing microservices; React for front-end
    development.
- **Messaging Systems**: Kafka or RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous data flow between
    services.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch for developing prediction
    models within plugins.

### Data Architecture

**Data Sources**: Real-time market data feeds, historical financial databases, user
input data through the interface.

### Data Storage

**Database Systems**: PostgreSQL for transactional data; MongoDB or Cassandra for
unstructured data storage like logs and temporary market data snapshots.

### Data Flow

Data flows from real-time market sources into individual predictors where it is
processed. Each predictor then sends its output to the fan-in LLM via a message queue.
The LLM synthesizes these inputs into actionable insights delivered through the user
interface.

### Security

Emphasis on encryption protocols (SSL/TLS) for all data in transit; role-based access
control (RBAC); regular audits; adherence to GDPR standards.

### Security Measures

- Implementation of OAuth2.0 for secure API access.
- Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
- Secure coding practices mandated in contributor guidelines.

### Integration and Interfaces

RESTful APIs facilitate interaction among services while GraphQL could be employed on
the frontend-backend interface for more efficient queries tailored to clients' needs.

### Quality Attributes

**Reliability**, ensuring uptime via redundancy in critical service components;
automated failover mechanisms.
 
**Maintainability**, facilitated by clear documentation standards set forth for
contributing developers regarding code style, architectures used, etc.

### Performance 

Efficient processing even under heavy load conditions through horizontal scaling
strategies supported by container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

### Scalability 

Cloud-native deployment approaches ensure resources are utilized dynamically based on
traffic demands—spinning up additional instances during peak times automatically.

### Deployment and Operations 

CI/CD pipelines built using GitHub Actions enabling frequent updates & rollbacks when
necessary; monitoring done using Prometheus combined with Grafana dashboards providing
real-time operational metrics tracking system health.
